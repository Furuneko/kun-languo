                    1. Did you allocate the bonus amount differently from what was originally suggested to you (i.e.,
                    equally splitting the bonus to the three employees)?

                    2. If you answered Yes to Question 1, how did you decide how much to allocate to each employee? If
                    you answered No to Question 1, why did you want to evenly split the bonus among the employees?
                    Please explain your thought process in detail in the box below.
