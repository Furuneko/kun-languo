            At the end of each production period of the decoding task, the <b>realized output</b> of each employee

            Thus, both the Manager and the other two employees will know how you performed on the decoding task

        The Manager and all three employees will learn whether an uncontrollable event has occurred, who is
        affected, and whether the impact was positive or negative.
        However, only the employee who was directly impacted will learn the amount of the effect.

    <li class="list-group-item">
        For example, if Employee A was negatively affected by an uncontrollable event of -4, the Manager,
        Employee B and Employee C will learn that a negative event has affected Employee A,
        but they will not know by how much.
